businessprocess Cronk for Icinga Web
====================================

The Cronk has been removed from the Icinga Web distribution.

See the devtracker for details why we removed it [1].

If you still like to use the Cronk feel free to do so, it is available at
NETWAYS open source portal [2]. If you want the source code, go to the Git
repository [3].
