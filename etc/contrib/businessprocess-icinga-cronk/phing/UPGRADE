  Upgrading to 2.4.0
  ------------------

  This release of Phing contains numerous significant enhancements over
  previous versions, such as new tasks (SSH, SCP, JsMin, SVN and many
  more),  documentation fixes and various bug fixes.
  
  There were also some changes that might break backwards compatibility,
  or change the behavior of Phing in such a way that requires changes
  to your build file(s).
  
  Backwards compatibility
  -----------------------

  This release drops or introduces functionality, which may have
  impact on your build process and require changes to your build files:

  * The way the "basedir" attribute (part of the "project" element in
    a build file) has changed. Phing now uses the current directory
    (getcwd()) to resolve relative base directories (such as ".").
    When the attribute is not present, the parent directory of the 
    build file is used instead. 

  * PHPUnit2 compatibility is dropped, Phing now requires at least
    PHPUnit 3.4 to run tests

  * The way Phing treats symbolic links was changed. Phing now considers 
    symbolic links to be files, regardless of whether they point to an 
    existing file or directory. Consequently, directory operations on 
    symbolic links will fail.

  * By default, Phing no longer automatically de-references symbolic 
    links. In other words, the CopyTask will now copy symbolic links 
    "as is", not duplicate the contents as with previous versions of Phing.
  
    To emulate the old behavior, the <fileset> element now accepts the
    boolean argument 'expandsymboliclinks'.
  
  PEAR package
  ------------
  
  This release splits the PEAR package in two packages, the existing
  'phing' and the new (and optional) 'phingdocs'. The latter package
  is listed as an optional dependency in the 'phing' package, and allows
  installation on deployment/production machines without the additional
  footprint of the documentation.
