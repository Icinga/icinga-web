[[ 1.11.1 - 2014-06-24 ]]

NOTE: Please apply the database schema update for your database!

[ Bugs ]

 * Add missing timestamp to SCHEDULE_FORCED_HOST_SVC_CHECKS data. (#5755)

 * Change category for reporting cronk to addons. (#5993)

 * Bypass data in StatusSummaryCronk when fields are missing. (#6126)

 * Before sending commands test data before push out the pipe. There was
   also an error that some commands use wrong data or never worked.

 * Override ExtJS implementation of 'TreeNode::removeChild()'. This helps
   add-ons to free memory when remove tree nodes (e.g. Business Process Addon).

 * Display role description in user depended role grid. (#6261)

 * Fix long plugin output to have multiline support. (#2653)

[[ 1.11.0 - 2014-03-13 ]]

[ NOTABLE CHANGES ]

 * Icinga Web 1.11 will require an IDO schema version of >= 1.11, this is
   required due to new database fields in the IDO and our queries. (# TODO

 * The database schema of Icinga Web hasn't been updated - 1.10.1 is still
   up to date.

 * Timezone handling has been fixed for duration and command fields.

   With 1.10.1 the timestamps have been switched to UTC, which did not work.

   Before that you would have to respect the offset between client and server.

   Now every field should show a default value based on server time, and only
   the server time is the reference point here. (#4983 #5713)

 * The ExtJS framework has been updated to 3.4.1.1, this should fix some
   problems and glitches with certain browsers, especially Internet Explorer.
   (#5620)

 * During Icinga reload the top bar will show a notice that a reload is in
   progress. (#5098 #5107)

 * Some macros in action_url and notes_url are now expanded (#1882)

[ Bugs ]

 * Minor grammar fixes (#5075)

 * When using hostgroup or service group filters or credentials the problem
   views could have contained duplicated, the SQL queries have been fixed.
   (#4913 #5020 #5660)

[ Other Features and Changes ]

 * Some links have been added (#4984)
