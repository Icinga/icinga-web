Features and Changes

 * Permission and Credential system has been revised and fixed in major parts

   The permissions are now logically grouped like this:
    ( (<hostperm1> OR <hostperm2>) AND (<serviceperm1> OR <serviceperm2>) )
    OR <contactpermission>

   Please make sure to read the issue for details and test if your permissions
   work as intended! (#3715 - https://dev.icinga.org/issues/3715)

   (Fixes #3578 #3625)

 * New Cronk Menu style - now a smaller list instead of big icons (#3396 #3430)
   Also the scrolling behavior has been improved for high amounts of Cronks

 * New filtering system (#3268 #3927 #3928 #3935)
   * interface redesigned
   * grouping in AND, OR or NOT subsections now possible

 * Migrate old filter to new ones - updated Cronk update task (#3981)
   Please see https://dev.icinga.org/issues/3981

 * DISTINCT for all queries (#3921 #3965)
   We need DISTINCT to avoid duplications in the data presented
   This breaks Oracle, because it can't distinct BLOB/CLOB fields

   * Added Merge View to views including BLOB data
   * Added BLOB field merging to Api

 * Workaround for missing initial PENDING states in status tables (#3844 #2602)

   When Icinga published a new host/service to the IDO the status table doesn't
   get filled with data for the host or service.

   The workaround should display these services as pending in any view.

   * Order rules have been removed from the file - add your own if your
     setup needs strict access rules (#3982)

   permission to do so (#3864)
