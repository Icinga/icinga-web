[[ 1.9.1 2013-09-08 ]]

[ Bugs ]

 * NOTE for Oracle users:
   the initial database schema for 1.9.0 and the update delivered an index
   whose identifier was too long

   Please make sure you have the index "target_key_unq_tgt_n_uq", the too
   long name was: target_key_unq_tgt_n_uq

   Update from 1.8.3 has been updated as well.

 * The initial database schema shipped with 1.9.0 had a wrong version of 1.8.4
   You don't have to change it as of now, but be aware of it when updating the
   schema in the future. (#4309)

   The schema itself was correct.

[[ 1.9.0 2013-05-07 ]]

[ IMPORTANT CHANGES ]

Permission and Credential system has been revised and fixed in major parts

   The permissions are now logically grouped like this:
    ( (<hostperm1> OR <hostperm2>) AND (<serviceperm1> OR <serviceperm2>) )
    OR <contactpermission>

   Please make sure to read the issue for details and test if your permissions
   work as intended! (#3715 - https://dev.icinga.org/issues/3715)

   (Fixes #3578 #3625)

New Cronk Menu style - now a smaller list instead of big icons (#3396 #3430)

   Also the scrolling behavior has been improved for high amounts of Cronks

   The default menu style can be changed in etc/conf.d/userpreferences.xml

New filtering system (#3268 #3927 #3928 #3935 #3981)

   * interface redesigned
   * grouping in AND, OR or NOT subsections now possible

Updating existing cronks for new filters and layout changes

   You should update any saved cronks to work correctly with the new version

   cd etc/
   ../bin/phing drop-customcronk-layout
   ../bin/phing upgrade-cronk-filter

   WARNING: The first statement drops all layout definitions from the cronks,
            this means the cronk will look like any fresh opened grid cronk.
            Any filter or sorting setting should be kept intact.

   Please see
   https://dev.icinga.org/issues/3981
   https://dev.icinga.org/issues/3431

New Apache2 configuration - replaces old .htaccess files (#2759 #2735)

   Make sure to update the config file for your apache and remove any old
   .htaccess file in your installation. Don't forget to reload ;)

   In addition access rules (Order,Deny) have been removed from the file.
   Please add your own if your setup needs strict access rules (#3982)

[ DEPRECATED ]

 * Tackle Cronk is deprecated with the release of 1.9
   and may be removed in one of the next releases! (#3452)

 * old SOAP Api has been removed completely now

   /icinga-web/soap on your webserver
   /pub/soap/ in your installation directory

   Please make sure to update your Apache configuration
   and remove the directory when you are using source installations!

 * make db-initialize / make db-deinitialize

[ Other Features and Changes ]

 * DISTINCT for all queries (#3921 #3965)
   We need DISTINCT to avoid duplications in the data presented
   This breaks Oracle, because it can't distinct BLOB/CLOB fields

   * Added Merge View to views including BLOB data
   * Added BLOB field merging to Api

 * Workaround for missing initial PENDING states in status tables (#3844 #2602)

   When Icinga published a new host/service to the IDO the status table doesn't
   get filled with data for the host or service.

   The workaround should display these services as pending in any view.

   * added bpaddon submodule (#3241)
 * Some minor Interface improvements (#3511)
   Wider Cronk tabs, bigger close button (bigger click area)
 * Added doc/README.RHEL with packaging tips
 * Allow clearcache for non-root users, when the user has
   permission to do so (#3864)
 * A search feature for users and groups have been added (#3909)

 * Info Box - Add Hostname in the title (#3174)
 * Make north-frame more flexible in size (#3934)
 * Added long_output to Api views for host and service (#3918)
