ICINGAAppKit core components

These are the components to modify agavi to our needs. So there living modified agavi classes like
users or some handlers for logging or storage.

Also there is an autoloader which loads only (!) AppKit classes. This behavior makes shure that
all AppKit objects you need are allocated lazy at your needs.
